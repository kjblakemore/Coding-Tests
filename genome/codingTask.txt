In any project, communication between the developer and the project team about specific requirements/specs/needs/desires for the solution is key.

In this coding task we will not have the opportunity for such back and forth. 

Along with your solution please note any questions or clarifications that you would have asked, and note any assumptions that you made in order to finish the coding task.


Problem
Given a sequence of DNA (found in the file codingTaskSequence.fa),
	Find all 23 base pair sequences that end in NGG (N can be any base)
		We will call the first 20 bases the 'target', and the final 3 bases the 'PAM'

From the possible 'targets':
	Filter them and score them.
	Produce an output with (at least):
		Target sequence
		PAM sequence
		Score
		Whether the target 'hits' a gene from the annotation file (codingTaskAnnotation.gff3)

Filter out:
    Targets that are not between 20%-80% GC content
    Targets with an ATG motifs
    Targets with homopolymers of more than 4 in a row (eg. ACGATCCCCCGACGTGATCGAGG, has 5 Câ€™s)
    
Score:
    Preference given to targets that have a PAM with a G or C as its first nucleotide
    Preference for targets closest to 45% GC content.
    Preference given to targets with high 'specificity' for their 'seed region' (nucleotides 13-20, 1-based numbering).
    	specificity meaning unquiesness of the 8-mer in the entire sequence file (codingTaskSequence.fa)
